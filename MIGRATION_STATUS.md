# WSL2 Migration Status Report

## ‚úÖ Successfully Completed Tasks

### 1. Repository Migration
- ‚úÖ Successfully cloned `diatonic-ai-prompts` to WSL2 Debian
- ‚úÖ Git configuration preserved and working
- ‚úÖ Remote origin properly connected to GitHub
- ‚úÖ All source files transferred correctly

### 2. Development Environment Setup  
- ‚úÖ Jekyll 4.3.1 installed via Debian system packages
- ‚úÖ Ruby 3.1.2 development environment configured
- ‚úÖ All basic dependencies installed (kramdown, rouge, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Docker available for containerized development

### 3. Repository Status
```bash
# Current location
/home/daclabgit/diatonic-ai-prompts

# Git status
git remote -v
# origin  https://github.com/Diatonic-AI/diatonic-ai-prompts.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/Diatonic-AI/diatonic-ai-prompts.git (push)

# All files present and accounted for
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Challenge

The system Jekyll installation has plugin compatibility issues. The main obstacle is that Jekyll expects certain gems to be available in bundler context, but we're trying to run without bundler to avoid compilation issues.

## üéØ Recommended Solutions (in order of preference)

### Option 1: Docker Development (RECOMMENDED)
Since Docker is available, this is the cleanest solution:

```bash
# Fix Docker permissions (requires logout/login after)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Then logout and login to WSL2

# Use the docker-dev.sh script we created
./docker-dev.sh
```

### Option 2: GitHub Codespaces
Since this is a GitHub repository, you can use GitHub Codespaces for development:
- Go to your repo on GitHub.com
- Click "Code" > "Codespaces" > "Create codespace"
- This gives you a full Jekyll environment in the cloud

### Option 3: Local bundler with gem installation
Install the missing gems locally:
```bash
gem install --user-install jekyll-feed jekyll-seo-tag jekyll-archives
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/gem/ruby/3.1.0/bin:$PATH"
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Option 4: Static file serving for preview
For simple preview while developing:
```bash
# Build static site (if it works)
jekyll build --config _config_minimal.yml --destination preview_site

# Serve with Python
cd preview_site
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Visit http://localhost:8000
```

## üìã What Works Right Now

1. **Git Operations**: ‚úÖ Fully functional
   ```bash
   git status
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **File Editing**: ‚úÖ All editors work
   - nano, vim, VS Code (if connected)
   - Full file system access

3. **GitHub Pages Deployment**: ‚úÖ Unchanged
   - Push to main branch ‚Üí automatic deployment
   - Live site: https://diatonic-ai.github.io/diatonic-ai-prompts

## üèÜ Migration Success Summary

**The migration IS successful** - you now have:
- Full WSL2 Debian development environment
- Complete repository with Git integration
- All source files accessible and editable
- GitHub Pages deployment pipeline intact

The only remaining item is getting the local Jekyll server running, which has multiple solutions above.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Try Docker approach first** (recommended)
2. **Use GitHub Codespaces** for cloud development
3. **Continue with direct file editing** + Git push workflow
4. **Install missing gems** if you prefer local Jekyll

Your migration to WSL2 is complete and functional!
